            <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
            starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them," he said, "all of this left scars on me."</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service.</li>
          <li>

            Charles Stakman, he returns to shcool study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
            military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to contorl malaria, disenfectants, and other applied sciences.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salay increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico
            to head a new plan pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease
            resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American breed, creating a
            strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexiac's wheat.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-wielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time
            to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yeilds.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2015." Argues that genetically modified
            crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
            dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long be before we called
            it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect,
          persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</p>
        <p>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</p>
